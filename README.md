This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.


## Things to check

### I added a UI for when the list is empty

To see it, delete every device manually or change "devices.json" in the API code for an empty list and restart the API, reload the main page, there you go.
